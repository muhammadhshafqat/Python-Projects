   - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Exponentiation Operator:**
   - Use `**` for exponentiation.

3. **Modulus Operator:**
   - Find the remainder using `%`.

4. **Trigonometric Functions:**
   - Calculate sine, cosine, and tangent. Supports degree and radian units.

5. **Square Root:**
   - Use `sqrt` to find the square root.

6. **Logarithmic Functions:**
   - Compute the logarithm using `log`.

7. **Factorial:**
   - Find the factorial of a non-negative integer using `fact`.

8. **Exponential Function:**
   - Calculate the exponential function using `exp`.

9. **Hypotenuse Calculation:**
   - Find the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using `hyp`.

10. **Bitwise Operations:**
    - Perform bitwise AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and XOR (`^`) operations.

11. **Additional Mathematical Functions:**
    - Minimum (`min`) and maximum (`max`) of two numbers.
    - Round a number (`round`), ceiling (`ceil`), and floor (`floor`) functions.
    - Absolute value (`abs`), power (`pow`), and greatest common divisor (`gcd`).

12. **Memory Functions:**
    - Store and recall results with `M+`, `M-`, `MR`, and `MC`.

   - View a list of all contacts with their information.

3. **Search Contacts:**
   - Search for contacts based on a specified term (case-insensitive).

4. **Remove Contact:**
   - Remove contacts matching a specified term.

5. **Update Contact:**
   - Update contact information based on a specified term.

6. **Get Unique Contacts:**
   - Display a list of unique contacts, eliminating duplicates.

7. **Export Contacts to File (CSV):**
   - Save contacts to a CSV file for external use.

8. **Import Contacts from File (CSV):**
   - Load contacts from a CSV file into the system.
